summary: "Conference presentation about the first fully-digital Bluetooth Low Energy backscatter uplink for wireless sensing systems"
abstract: "Wireless links using backscatter communication
offer the advantages of reduced complexity and orders of
magnitude lower power consumption than active radios.
However, the need for specialized receiver systems has limited
the use of backscatter in wireless sensing applications. To
address this need, we introduce the first backscatter-based
wireless sensor tag that can stream sensor data to any of the
billions of existing Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) devices,
including smartphones, tablets, and PCs. The FPGA-based
“BLE Backscatter Sensor Node” (BBSN) uses an external
carrier source and requires no modifications to smartphone,
tablet, or PC hardware or software whatsoever. The device
transmits a 1.0 Mbps data stream with BLE-compatible
frequency-shift keying modulation. The backscatter modulator
consumes only 158 pJ/bit, making it over 60X more energy
efficient than a conventional BLE active radio (>10 nJ/bit)."
