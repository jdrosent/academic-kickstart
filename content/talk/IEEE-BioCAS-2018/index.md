summary: "Conference presentation about the NeuroDisc's initial 6.25 Mbps DQPSK backscatter uplink"
abstract: "Wireless brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) used for
fundamental neuroscience research in freely moving non-human
primates (NHPs) require communication systems capable of
transferring large volumes of recorded neural data while consuming
minimal power. We introduce a 6.25 Mbps differential
quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) backscatter wireless
uplink for the NeuroDisc BCI, operating in the 902-928 MHz
industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)-band. The backscatter
uplink consumes 77.5 uW (only 0.06% of the system power budget),
yielding a communication energy efficiency of 12.4 pJ/bit,
while the measured error vector magnitude of the DQPSK
constellation is 9.69%. The neural recording front-end has a
measured input-referred noise of 2.35 uVrms at a maximum
sampling rate of 20 kSps. We present end-to-end recording and
wireless uplink validation with pre-recorded neural data as well
as in vivo recordings from a pigtail macaque."
