summary: "Conference presentation about a radiation sensor in the RaD-X payload."
abstract: "The small size and low manufacturing costs of semiconductor
dosimeters could make them ideal sensors for real time
measurements of biologically harmful radiation at aviation
altitudes. This paper presents the system design, accumulated
dose measurements, and dose rate calculation results
obtained from the Teledyne UDOS001 total ionizing dose (TID)
micro dosimeter as part of the NASA Radiation Dosimetry
Experiment (RaD-X) stratospheric balloon mission. A commercial
class TID sensor was used for the mission, measuring
35 mm x 25 mm x 4.5 mm with a power consumption of 280mW.
The sensor was used to measure accumulated dose for 20 hours,
with 18 hours of data at altitudes above 20 km, and it was
integrated into the RaD-X payload with a custom interface
printed circuit board, which provided power conditioning and
signal buffering. An analog-to-digital (ADC) converter was
then used to sample the sensors analog output at 15 Hz. To
ensure the sensor temperature remained within operating limits
(-30C to 40C), a thermal control system was used to maintain
the temperature of the sensor. Post-flight analysis showed that
the TID measured dose rates were in good agreement with an
industry standard tissue equivalent proportional counter."
