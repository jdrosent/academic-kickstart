title: "NASA Outreach: HUNCH"
subtitle: "**High school students United with NASA to Create Hardware (HUNCH)**. 


The [HUNCH mission](https://nasahunch.com/) is to empower and inspire students through a Project Based Learning program where high school students learn 21st century skills and 
have the opportunity to launch their careers through the participation in the design and fabrication of real world valued products for NASA.


[NASA HUNCH article in the Daily Press](https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nws-evg-aviation-academy-nasa-20160527-story.html)


At NASA, I had the privilege of serving for three years as a HUNCH mentor at Denbigh High School's Aviation Academy in Newport News, VA. The program challenges students to build items that help NASA 
and astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Through weekly visits with my class, we completed three main projects: a full-size mock-up of the ISS Destiny Science Module 
to educate the public about ISS; a revised tool-belt to help astronauts in zero-gravity; and a high school course where the students assemble space-grade lockers for housing micro-gravity 
science experiments (the first locker launched to ISS in 2017!)"
