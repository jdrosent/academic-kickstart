title: "National Science Foundation's Research Experience for Teachers"
subtitle: "**Collaborating with a local high school teacher on research thanks to NSF's RET Program**. 


*The [Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program](http://centerforneurotech.org/feature-stories/when-science-teachers-return-multiple-years-cnt%E2%80%99s-research-experience-teachers)
 is supporting middle and high school teachers who
 return to the Center for Neurotechnology (CNT) year-after-year, benefiting not only those teachers’ 
 students and peer educators, but the CNT’s education programs and researchers as well.*


I had the privilege of working with local high school teach Alexandra Pike for two summers on antenna design and characterization for wireless brain-computer interfaces.
Working together with the help of former UW PhD students Apoorva Sharma, Tomas Arenas, and Eleftherios Kampianakis, we were able to design and evaluate a new wireless
system that could enable wireless recording of neural signals from freely moving monkeys."
