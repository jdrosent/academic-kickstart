title: "Glowing Pickle Demo"
subtitle: "**Talking with UW Women in Science & Engineering**. 


The [WiSE program](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/studentprogs/wise) recruits and supports women of all ethnic backgrounds in science and engineering (S&E) and fosters a healthy academic and social environment for men and women in engineering at all levels of study.


I spoke with a group of summer WiSE students who were entering their freshman year at the University of Washington. I spoke with them about electrical engineering curriculum 
as well as opportunities for internships, jobs, and research during and after their degree. We then explored the *Glowing Pickle* demo
and discussed the interesting physics that occurs when you electrify a pickle."
