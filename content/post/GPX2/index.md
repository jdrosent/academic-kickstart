title: "NASA: GPX2 Nanosatellite"
subtitle: "**A nanosatellite for evaluating low-cost, high-precision GPS receivers for rendez-vous and docking**


NASA's GPS Experiment (GPX2) is a nanosatellite mission focused on developing
a CubeSat platform for testing carrier-wave differential GPS (CDGPS) for precise relative
navigation between low-cost satellites.


In the summer of 2017 I returned to full-time work at NASA for the summer after my first year of graduate school.
I served as the Electrical Engineering Lead on GPX-2. I worked with the GPX-2 team to formulate the
concept of operations, mission requirements, as well as the assembly, integration, and test
plan. Additionally, I designed a six-layer, PC/104-form factor flight computer based on the STM32F4 ARM-Cortex-M4 MCU.
Technical responsibilities included schematic design, board layout, fabrication, assembly,
and bench-top validation. In addition, I GPX-2 is set to launch in 2021."
