Hello, I am a Ph.D. student and National Science Graduate Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.

My research focuses on developing novel wireless sensing systems that are smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. These systems in turn enable exploration of diverse, extreme environments, from the brain to the solar system.

Much of my work focuses on embedded-electronics and instrumentation hardware for government, industry, and academic research. Examples include nanosatellite avionics, ultra-low power wireless brain-computer interfaces, and a radiation sensing system for high-altitude balloons. For an overview of my experience, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf). For more details on my work, check out my [Publications](publication) and Projects on this site.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
