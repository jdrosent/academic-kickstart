#The goal of my research is to provide high-quality measurements that inform high-quality decisions. Rapidly-improving computing systems and artificial intelligence offer tremendous opportunties for understanding large data sets. However, these systems are only as good as they data they are fed. Public trust relies on high-quality results and high-quality data.

#computing systems and artificial intelligence offer tremendous opportunities for finding meaning in large, complex data sets. However, the outputs of these systems--and the trust that

#My work has contributed to improved aviation safety [measuring biologically harmful radiation from space](post/radx/) to improve aviation safety while working at NASA as well as 
#[measuring neural ensemble activity in the brain](post/neurodisc/) to develop revolutionary treatments at the 
#[UW Center for Neurotechnology](http://www.csne-erc.org/). 
#The focus of my dissertation is on wireless sensing systems that improve our ability to measure and interpret challenging phenomena, like [neural activity](post/neurodisc/). 
#Common wireless solutions, like Bluetooth and WiFi require far too much power ([did you realize that nearly half your phone is a battery?](https://youtu.be/0DtW52b6t30?t=654)). 
#By reducing the size, weight, and power needs of our wireless sensors, we can enable exploration of diverse, extreme environments, from the brain to the solar system.
#Examples include nanosatellite avionics, ultra-low power

#I believe that publications alone are not enough to communicate with the public, especially for tax payer-funded research, therefore

Welcome to my website. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate and National Science Graduate Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW).

My dissertation research focuses on the development of [wireless brain-computer interfaces](post/neurodisc/), exploring how architectural innovation 
in embedded systems can reduce the size, weight, and power consumption of wireless systems and enable new methods for monitoring and treating for neurological disorders. 

Much of my work has been in **novel** **applications** **of** **electromagnetic** **theory**, **ultra-low** **power** **wireless** **embedded** **systems**, and **electronic** **instrumentation**
**for** **extreme** **environments**. This work have contributed to the [development of neural prosthetics](post/neurodisc/) at the [UW Center for Neurotechnology](http://www.csne-erc.org/) and the 
[measurement of biologically-harmful space radiation at NASA to improve aviation safety](post/radx/). 

Outside of research, I'm passionate about [outreach, mentoring, and teaching](/teaching/). Also lots of [hobbies](/travel/).
