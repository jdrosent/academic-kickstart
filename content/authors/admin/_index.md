#The goal of my research is to provide high-quality measurements that inform high-quality decisions. Rapidly-improving computing systems and artificial intelligence offer tremendous opportunties for understanding large data sets. However, these systems are only as good as they data they are fed. Public trust relies on high-quality results and high-quality data.
#The rapid improvements in 
#computing systems and artificial intelligence offer tremendous opportunities for finding meaning in large, complex data sets. However, the outputs of these systems--and the trust that

#My work has contributed to improved aviation safety [measuring biologically harmful radiation from space](post/radx/) to improve aviation safety while working at NASA as well as 
#[measuring neural ensemble activity in the brain](post/neurodisc/) to develop revolutionary treatments at the 
#[UW Center for Neurotechnology](http://www.csne-erc.org/). 
#The focus of my dissertation is on wireless sensing systems that improve our ability to measure and interpret challenging phenomena, like [neural activity](post/neurodisc/). 
#Common wireless solutions, like Bluetooth and WiFi require far too much power ([did you realize that nearly half your phone is a battery?](https://youtu.be/0DtW52b6t30?t=654)). 
#By reducing the size, weight, and power needs of our wireless sensors, we can enable exploration of diverse, extreme environments, from the brain to the solar system.
#Examples include nanosatellite avionics, ultra-low power 
#wireless brain-computer interfaces, and a radiation sensing system for high-altitude balloons. 
#I believe that publications alone are not enough to communicate with the public, especially for tax payer-funded research, therefore
#it is our responsibility as researchers to provide full-value to the public and earn their support through

Hello, I am a Ph.D. student and National Science Graduate Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW).

"Garbage in, garbage out" is a phrase that describes a common pitfall in computing. 
My expertise is in providing high-quality measurements that helps formulate high-quality decisions. 
My work has contributed to [improving aviation safety at NASA](post/radx/) and the [development of neural prosthetics](post/neurodisc/) at the 
[UW Center for Neurotechnology](http://www.csne-erc.org/). 

The focus of my dissertation is on improving [wireless brain-computer interfaces](post/neurodisc/) by reducing power consumption. 
[Did you realize that nearly half your phone is a battery?](https://youtu.be/0DtW52b6t30?t=654)
By reducing the size, weight, and power needs of our wireless sensors, we can enable exploration of diverse, extreme environments, from the brain to the solar system.

I have well-rounded experience working on embedded-electronics and instrumentation hardware for government, industry, and academic research:
- **Government -** nanosatellites and drones
- **Industry -** wearable electronics and satellite internet hardware
- **Academia -** brain-computer interfaces and wireless theory

Essential critical thinking skills can be found across science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM). I am passionate about engaging with the public through [STEAM outreach, mentoring, and teaching](/teaching/).

For an overview of my experience, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf). For more details on my work, check out my [Publications](publication) and [Projects](#projects). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
